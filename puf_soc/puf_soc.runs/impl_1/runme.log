WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net design_1_i/ro_puf_0/inst/roSet1/out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin design_1_i/ro_puf_0/inst/roSet1/out_INST_0/O, cell design_1_i/ro_puf_0/inst/roSet1/out_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
